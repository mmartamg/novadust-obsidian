> A color theme inspired by the stars

This is **NOVADUST** for Obsidian, a dark blue color theme designed for high contrast yet maintaining the softness and warmth necessary for endless, comfortable work.

## Features
### Layout
The theme features a modern layout, separating each section into a round-cornered box. I believe the style is called bento-box,but I'm not entirely sure. Honestly, it just looks really cool.

### Color contrast
One big problem I had with a lot of themes I tried was the lack of differentiation, everything blended together. So I decided to make everything stand out, every color would be important. Because of this you have a different color for each type of title, lists and text formatting element. Pretty much every element is different to make it easier to identify.

### Code
The colors had to look nice on the code block, as this isn't just an Osidian theme - you can also find it on [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=novadust.novadust)

### Easy on the eyes
I've always loved blue themes. It's my color.
But I didn't love how a fair amount seemed to enjoy burning your retina.
So one of my goals was that, while it should stand out, it should also be soft. A cold theme with warm undertones if you will. I think I've succeeded in this, but let me know what you think.
